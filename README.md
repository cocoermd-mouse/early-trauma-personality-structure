A structured theoretical analysis of personality vulnerability, adaptive splitting, and integration pathways following early traumatic experiences.
# Early Trauma and Personality Structural Risk

## Overview
This repository contains a theoretical research paper examining how early traumatic experiences can form a structurally vulnerable personality foundation, leading to adaptive functional splitting and long-term systemic risk.

The paper focuses on:
- Structural vulnerability caused by early trauma
- Compensatory high-functioning development
- Public/private personality splitting as a risk-mitigation strategy
- Long-term instability and collapse risk
- A structured pathway toward psychological integration
